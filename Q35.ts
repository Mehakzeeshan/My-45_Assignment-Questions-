They can cause you harm. \n  If you are thinking of having apet then dogs, cats and rabbit would be a good choice, \n First of all they all are terrestrial and are very friendly and easily become your friends and easy to handle and train \n as well as in small in size except for the dogs but the dogs are also not as big as other animals. \n Secondly their food is locally available in the market and they can also eat what we want them to eat so they won't be costly for you to afford. Infact, any of these animals would make a great pet.'"
